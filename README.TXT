This is a work in progress extending Kao et al.'s metaphor model to continuous semantics.

The .pdf document 'metaphor_paper.pdf' is the paper itself in which the model is proposed. It outlines behavioral experiments that were conducted to evaluate the model's predictions. There's also a poster presented at ESSLLI'19 summarizing the work. Note: the model has changed a lot since this draft was written; an updated version of the paper to come soon. 

The 'code' folder contains the model itself as well as an R script which analyzes the model's predictions and compares them to the experimentally collected priors (contained in the 'data' folder).
