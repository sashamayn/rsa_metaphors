The .pdf document 'metaphor_paper.pdf' is the paper itself in which the model is proposed. It is a work in progress and outlines behavioral experiments that are being run to evaluate the model's prediction.

The .py executable 'metaphor_source.py' is my implementation of the proposed model. It takes in the priors (refered to as the 'demo dataset' in the paper) contained in 'typicalities.csv'. It does not take any command line arguments. To run it, type in the terminal window: python3 metaphor_source.py. It will print out the intepretations for each intention-utterance pair. For example output, see Appendix 7.2 in the paper.
